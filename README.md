Joss is a modular JS framework which has as its main goal to *get out of the
developer's way*. It is not "easy"; the goal is to never be so "smart" that the
developer spends a large amount of time trying to turn features off. That said,
it's entirely possible that this framework is not really suitable for anyone
other than my weird self!  Github's a good place to put it, and if it turns out
to be useful for somebody else, that's great.
